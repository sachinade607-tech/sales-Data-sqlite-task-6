📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use SQLite with Python (sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib) to analyze sales data. The goal is to pull key business insights such as total sales, revenue trends, top products, and order values, and visualize them with simple charts.
⚙️ Tools & Technologies
SQLite (lightweight database)
Python (sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook (for analysis & visualization)
📂 Dataset
The dataset is stored in an SQLite database file: sales_data.db
🚀 Analysis Performed
1. Total Quantity & Revenue by Product:
Queried total sales quantity and total revenue for each product.
Visualized revenue using a bar chart.
2. Top Products
Laptops contributed the highest revenue.
Headphones & Keyboards had the highest sales volume.
3. Daily Revenue Trend
Tracked revenue across days to identify peak sales.
Found specific days (e.g., Sept 1, Sept 2) as top performers.
4. Average Order Value (AOV)
Calculated average revenue per order.
Helps in setting customer spend benchmarks.
5. Revenue Contribution % by Product
Laptops contributed the largest share of revenue.
Accessories contributed less revenue despite higher unit sales.
6. Best Sales Day
Identified the single best-performing sales day by revenue.

Revenue Share Analysis
💡 Key Insights
Premium products (like Laptops) contribute most of the revenue.
Accessories (Headphones, Keyboards) sell in large quantities but contribute less to revenue.
There are peak sales days that should be analyzed further for promotions or campaigns.
Cross-selling & Bundling Strategy can help increase the Average Order Value (AOV).
Maintaining inventory balance between high-demand accessories and premium products is crucial.
📝 Recommendations
Focus marketing on high-value items (Laptops, Mobiles).
Bundle accessories with premium products to increase AOV.
Replicate strategies from best sales days (e.g., promotions, discounts).
Ensure stock availability for high-demand items like Headphones.
